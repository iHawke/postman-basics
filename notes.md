# Introduction to Postman course notes

## Session 1 - Postman Basics

### Lesson 1 - What is Postman?

#### 💡 - Summary
- Postman is a tool that mimics a web-browser and allows us to easily work with APIs.
- Postman is used to build HTTP requests that we send to the web-server running the APIs.

### Lesson 2 - How to install Postman

#### 💡 - Summary
- There are two ways to run Postman: 
   * As a standalone app or 
   * Directly in the browser
- The standalone app is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Postman on the web works from any browser. You'll also need the Postman desktop agent in order to use the browser based version.  DO NOT use the Google Chrome extension as this is deprecated and no longer updated.

#### 📚 - Resources

* [Download Postman App](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
* [Open Postman on the web](https://go.postman.co/build)
* [Postman Desktop Agent (scroll down)](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

### Lesson 3 - Your first request with Postman

#### 💡 - Summary

- To use an API you need to read the API documentation. Please read [Simple Books API documentation](./api.md) first.
- Work in Postman is organized in Workspaces.
- A status code 200 (or any status like 2XX) indicates that the request was successful.

### Lesson 4 - HTTP

#### 💡 - Summary

- How HTTP works?
```angular2html
   telnet https://simple-books-api.glitch.me 80
   GET / HTTP/1.1
```  
- The API we are using the HTTPS protocol.
- HTTPS stands for Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
- HTTPS ensures that the connection is encrypted.
- All APIs should use HTTPS.
- From our point of view HTTP and HTTPS are the same.
- The HTTP request message will contain: 
   * URL (address)
   * Request method (GET, POST, PUT, ...)
   * Headers (User-Agent: Postman)
   * Body
- The HTTP response message will contain: 
   * Status code (200, 404, 500, ...)
   * Headers
   * Body

### Lesson 5 - Postman collections and variables

#### 💡 - Summary
- You can save requests so that you can re-use them later on.
- All requests need to be added to a Postman collection.
- Usually you will have a Postman collection for each API.
- We are storing the base address of the API in a collection variable called `baseUrl`. 
- Our saved baseUrl will be displayed as `{{baseUrl}}` in the address bar.
- Variables allow us to avoid repeating the same information.
- Variables allow us to easily make changes.
- A Postman variable has two states
   * INITIAL VALUE - This will be available to others if you share the collection.
   * CURRENT VALUE - This is private to you and this is the value that Postman uses.

### Lesson 6 - POST request / API Authentication

#### 💡 - Summary
- A `POST` request allows you to send data in the request body.
- The endpoint for submitting orders requires authentication.
- Some APIs/endpoints are public and require no authentication.
- Other APIs/endpoints are private and require authentication.
- An access token is temporary password generated by the API.
- To send JSON, select the POST request method and from the Body select `Raw` and from the list `JSON`.


### Lesson 7 - Query parameters

#### 💡 - Summary
- JSON is the most popular format that APIs use to send data.
- Query parameters start after the `?` in the URL.
   * example : `{{baseUrl}}/books?type=fiction`
- The format is `key=value`
- Multiple query parameters are delimited in the URL with an `&`. 
   * example: `foo=1&bar=2`
- Depending on the API, some query parameters can be optional or mandatory.
- A response status 400 indicates an issue with the request data.
- You can enable and disable parameters by clicking the checkbox associated with each key-value pair.

### Lesson 8 - Assignment
- Study the API documentation and use the `limit` query parameter in the `/books` endpoint.
- Try out different values.
- Can you make the API return a status code 400?


### Lesson 9 - Path variables

#### 💡 - Summary
- `:bookId` is a path variable in the URL.
- This endpoint allows us to specify a value that changes all the time, depending on the book.
- `:bookId` is just a placeholder and does not get sent.
- You can use path variables in combination with query parameters (if the API accepts this).


### Lesson 10 - JSON format

#### 💡 - Summary
- You need to specify valid JSON, otherwise the server won't understand your request.
- Use double-quotes `""` for strings, separate key-value pairs with a comma sign `,`
- Numbers, booleans don't need to be between quotes.
- Postman will indicate when your JSON is invalid.


### Problem:
- Create the POST request to order a book.
- Try ordering a book that is not in stock.

### Lesson 11 - Random test data

#### 💡 - Summary
- You can use a special type of Postman variable to generate random data
   * example: `{{$randomFullName}}`
- To inspect the request body you can use the Postman console.

#### 📚 - Resources

* [Dynamic variables in Postman](https://postman-quick-reference-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dynamic-variables.html)

### Lesson 12 - Is Postman the right tool for me?

#### 💡 - Summary
- Postman is a tool for dealing with APIs.
- Postman cannot work with User Interfaces, click buttons and fill out forms.
- Postman is not a performance testing tool.
- Postman can be used for security testing but has not been designed for this purpose.

### Lesson 13 - Viewing existing orders

#### 💡 - Summary
- Using the GET request method on the `orders` endpoint will give us a list of orders.
- Using the POST request method on the same endpoint will let us create a new order.

### Lesson 14 - Assignment

- Look at the API documentation and identify the endpoint that would allow you to see a single order.

### Lesson 15 - PATCH request

#### 💡 - Summary
- A `PATCH` request is typically used for updating existing data.
- A `PATCH` usually does a partial update, by changing only some of the properties.

### Lesson 16 - DELETE request

#### 💡 - Summary
- A `DELETE` request is used for deleting data.
- If you try to get the same data with a `GET` request, you will get a `404 Not Found` status code.

## Session 2 - Test automation with Postman

### Lesson 17 - Introduction to test automation

#### 💡 - Summary

- In this second part of the course, our goal is to automate testing of the API.
- So far, we have done manual testing but we want to write API tests to avoid having to manually re-test the API

### Lesson 18 - Your first API tests

#### 💡 - Summary
- We are looking at the response to understand if the API is working properly.
- With API tests we want to avoid manually re-testing the API.
- Tests in Postman are written in JavaScript.
- Tests are executed ONLY after the response has arrived from the API.
- Postman uses an assertion library called Chai.js
- Testing the response status code is one of the easiest tests you can write.
- When writing tests, we want to make sure the tests fail.
- To make the assertions on a JSON response, you first need to parse it.
- To see the contents of a JavaScript variable you can use `console.log()`
- To get a property of an object, you can use this syntax: `someobject.someproperty`
   * alternative syntax: `someobject["someproperty"]`

#### 📚 - Resources

* [Chai Assertion Library](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/)

### Lesson 19 - Assignment
- Add tests for all the requests in the collection that verify the status code.

### Lesson 20 - Postman variables

#### 💡 - Summary 
- Postman variables are fundamental to automating testing of the API.
- Postman environments (environment variables) are good if you have multiple testing environments (localhost, testing, production)
- Postman collection variables are saved in the collection.
- Postman global variables are available to all collection in a workspace.
- We use Postman global variables as the data we save is not that important after the execution has stopped.

### Lesson 21 - Extracting data from the response

#### 💡 - Summary

- Having hardcoded values in requests can make the API tests fail if the data changes.
- We are using the filter function available on all arrays to remove the books that are not available.
- Always use `console.log()` to view the data you are trying to set as a variable.

#### 📚 - Resources

* [Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)

### Lesson 22 - Assignment
- Test that the book extracted from the response is of type `non-fiction`
- Ensure that the test fails.

### Lesson 23 - Assignment
- Use the Postman global variable `bookId` in the requests "Get single book" and "Order book".
- Write a test that verifies the stock is >0
   * use this assertion as a starting point: `pm.expect(1).to.be.above(2)`

### Lesson 24 - Collection runner

#### 💡 - Summary

- The Collection runner is a built-in functionality of Postman.
- The Collection runner allows you to execute the entire collection with just one click.
- Make sure to check (:white_check_mark:) the "Save response" box as this will allow you to inspect the response body.

### Lesson 25 - Request execution order

#### 💡 - Summary
- If you run a Postman collection, the default order is as you have it in the collection.
- You can change that order if you use `postman.setNextRequest` and specify the name of the next request
- If you wish to stop the execution prematurely, you can do so by running `postman.setNextRequest(null)`

### Lesson 26 - Postman monitors

#### 💡 - Summary
- Creating a Postman monitor ensures that you can run a Postman collection according to a pre-defined schedule.
- Running the collection will be handled by Postman on their infrastructure, you don't need to keep Postman open.
- If you are not familiar with continuous integration servers like Jenkins, GitLab CI or TeamCity, this is a quick and easy way to access a Postman collection.
- The API needs to be accessible from any network.

### Lesson 27 - Newman

#### 💡 - Summary
- Newman is a CLI tool that can take a Postman collection, run all the tests and generate a report at the end.
- Newman does not have an interface, you need to work with it from the terminal.
- Often Newman is installed on an integration server like Jenkins, GitLab CI or TeamCity.
- To run Newman on your computer, you need to have Node.js installed.
   * you can download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (download the LTS version)
- To install newman, run the command: `npm install -g newman`
- Check if newman is install with: `newman --version`
- There are three ways to access a collection from Newman:
   * Export the collection as a JSON file.
   * Share with a public link.
   * Use the Postman API to get the collection.

### Lesson 29 - CI/CD overview

#### 💡 - Summary
- Newman is particularly useful when you integrate it with a CI server.
